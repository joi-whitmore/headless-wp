                    Transformation isn’t just about mindset; <strong>it lives in the body too</strong>.
                    You can’t journal, meditate, or “positive-think” your way out of patterns that are wired into
                    your nervous system. If your body still expects stress, burnout, or over-giving, no amount of
                    mindset work will change that.

                    That’s why we go <strong>deeper</strong>. Through somatic therapy, Reiki, and coaching, we don’t
                    just talk about
                    change—we create it. We get into the places where your patterns actually live, so you can stop
                    understanding what’s wrong and start feeling what’s possible.
